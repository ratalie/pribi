## float

Utilities for controlling the wrapping of content around an element.

| Class | Styles |
| --- | --- |
| `float-right` | `float: right;` |
| `float-left` | `float: left;` |
| `float-start` | `float: inline-start;` |
| `float-end` | `float: inline-end;` |
| `float-none` | `float: none;` |

Use the `float-right` utility to float an element to the right of its container:

Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.

Use the `float-left` utility to float an element to the left of its container:

Use the `float-start` and `float-end` utilities, which use [logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties/Basic_concepts) to map to either the left or right side based on the text direction:

left-to-right

Use the `float-none` utility to reset any floats that are applied to an element:

Prefix a `float` utilitywith a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at mediumscreen sizes and above:

```
<img class="float-right md:float-left" src="/img/mountains.jpg" />
```
