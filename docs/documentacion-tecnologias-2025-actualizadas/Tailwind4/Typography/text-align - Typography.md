Utilities for controlling the alignment of text.

| Class | Styles |
| --- | --- |
| `text-left` | `text-align: left;` |
| `text-center` | `text-align: center;` |
| `text-right` | `text-align: right;` |
| `text-justify` | `text-align: justify;` |
| `text-start` | `text-align: start;` |
| `text-end` | `text-align: end;` |

Use the `text-left` utility to left align the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I *was* a marine biologist.

```
<p class="text-left">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

Use the `text-right` utility to right align the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I *was* a marine biologist.

```
<p class="text-right">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

Use the `text-center` utility to center the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I *was* a marine biologist.

```
<p class="text-center">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

Use the `text-justify` utility to justify the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I *was* a marine biologist.

```
<p class="text-justify">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

Prefix a `text-align` utilitywith a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at mediumscreen sizes and above:

```
<p class="text-left md:text-center ...">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</p>
```
