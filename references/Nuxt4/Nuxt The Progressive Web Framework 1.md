## Installation

Get started with Nuxt quickly with our online starters or start locally with your terminal.

## Play Online

If you just want to play around with Nuxt in your browser without setting up a project, you can use one of our online sandboxes:

Open on StackBlitz

Open on CodeSandbox

Or follow the steps below to set up a new Nuxt project on your computer.

## New Project

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - [`20.x`](https://nodejs.org/en) or newer (but we recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))
- **Text editor** - There is no IDE requirement, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [official Vue extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously known as Volar) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), which, along with [other JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/), offers great Nuxt support right out-of-the-box.
- **Terminal** - In order to run Nuxt commands

Additional notes for an optimal setup:
- **Node.js**: Make sure to use an even numbered version (20, 22, etc.)
- **Nuxtr**: Install the community-developed [Nuxtr extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxtr.nuxtr-vscode)
- **WSL**: If you are using Windows and experience slow HMR, you may want to try using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) which may solve some performance issues.
- **Windows slow DNS resolution** - instead of using `localhost:3000` for local dev server on Windows, use `127.0.0.1` for much faster loading experience on browsers.

Open a terminal (if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

Alternatively, you can find other starters or themes by opening [nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new/) and following the instructions there.

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code:

Terminal

```bash
code <project-name>
```

Or change directory into your new project from your terminal:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

Well done! A browser window should automatically open for [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Now that you've created your Nuxt project, you are ready to start building your application.
