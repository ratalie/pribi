## About

The `<Calendar />` component is built on top of the [Reka UI Calendar](https://www.reka-ui.com/docs/components/calendar.html) component, which uses the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package to handle dates.

If you're looking for a range calendar, check out the [Range Calendar](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/range-calendar.html) component.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add calendar
```

TIP

The component depends on the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package, which solves a lot of the problems that come with working with dates and times in JavaScript. Check [Dates & Times in Reka UI](https://www.reka-ui.com/docs/guides/dates.html) for more information and installation instructions.

## Datepicker

You can use the `<Calendar />` component to build a date picker. See the [Date Picker](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/date-picker.html) page for more information.
