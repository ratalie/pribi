## Drawer

A drawer component for vue.

[Component Source](https://github.com/unovue/shadcn-vue/tree/dev/apps/www/src/registry/default/ui/drawer) [API Reference](https://github.com/unovue/vaul-vue)

## About

Drawer is built on top of [Vaul Vue](https://github.com/unovue/vaul-vue).

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn-vue@latest add drawer
```

## Usage

### Scale Background

If you want the background to have a zoom effect, you need to add the `vaul-drawer-wrapper` attribute to the root component.

## Examples

### Responsive Dialog

You can combine the `Dialog` and `Drawer` components to create a responsive dialog. This renders a `Dialog` component on desktop and a `Drawer` on mobile.
