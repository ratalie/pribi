## Usage

## Data Table

You can use the `<Table />` component to build more complex data tables. Combine it with [@tanstack/vue-table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) to create tables with sorting, filtering and pagination.

See the [Data Table](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/data-table.html) documentation for more information.

You can also see an example of a data table in the [Tasks](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/examples/tasks.html) demo.
