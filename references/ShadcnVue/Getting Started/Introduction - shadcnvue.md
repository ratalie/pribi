## Introduction

Re-usable components built with Reka UI, and Tailwind CSS.

An unofficial, community-led [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). We are not affiliated with [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn), but we did get his blessing before creating a Vue version of his work. This project was born out of the need for a similar project for the Vue ecosystem.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste or use the CLI to add to your apps.

**What do you mean not a component library?**

It means you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm, with no plans to publish it.

Pick the components you need. Use the CLI to automatically add the components, or copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

*Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.*
