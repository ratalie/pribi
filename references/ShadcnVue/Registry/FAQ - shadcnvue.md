### What does a complex component look like?

Here's an example of a complex component that installs a page, two components, a composable, a format date utils and a config file.

### How do I add a new Tailwind color?

To add a new color you need to add it to `cssVars` and `tailwind.config.theme.extend.colors`.

The CLI will update the project CSS file and tailwind.config.js file. Once updated, the new colors will be available to be used as utility classes: `bg-brand` and `text-brand-accent`.

### How do I add a Tailwind animation?

To add a new animation you add it to `tailwind.config.theme.extend.animation` and `tailwind.config.theme.extend.keyframes`.
